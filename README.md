# Recipe App

The Recipe app keeps track of all your recipes, ingredients, and inventory. 
It will allow you to save ingredients, keep track of what you have, create recipes, and generate a shopping list based on what you have and what you are missing from a recipe. 
Also, since sharing recipes is an important part of cooking the app should allow you to make them public so anyone can access them.

This app was created with Rails, including Devise for authentication and CanCanCan for authorizations.

There is documentation with the differents Endpoints of the API, where the Developer can check the routes and parameters that he need
